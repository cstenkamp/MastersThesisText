Zitat JOHANNES über SidBERT: "When using traditional pattern-matching search, these search queries may yield no results or return courses within another domain that by chance contain the same words but are otherwise unrelated to the domain the student is looking for." (-> zum thema hilft auch in Search engines etc)

### Course Recommendation

	=> We want feature-directions.
	* Show Sample: Movie Tuner Interface (here or [*])
	
TODO: quotes from Johannes about how making the choice easier for students is very important, but that categorizing educational resources is a challenge.

### Derrarc2015's algorithm

-->

* What they did can definitely be used for what I want to do here if it works well enough
* Their motivation is thus also mine: Explainable AI but data-driven 
	* They want to get "commonsense reasoning such as interpolation and a fortiori inference", but learned automatically. 
	* As they claim, "commonsense reasoning" <=> "how different concepts and entities are semantically related" <=> CS
		because "CS qualitative spatial relations" <=> "required semantic relations for reasoning"
		=> Their aim is to create a structured knowledge base (see [+])
* Few grains of salt (no regions but only dots, domain-specific)
* Does their algorithm work for the given dataset?
* Seems like a small community of only these guys
	* Active Community, cool ideas, but only citing themselves and all basing on Derrarc2015 (..and having him as co-author)
	* Sanity-check the validity of their claims as external person
		* Also with other datasets beyond the always-same-style of their ones
	=> "If this algorithm is as good as they claim, that would be great, but we have reasons to not trust their claim so we're checking them."
* Also their published code is crap => I want to create a better architecture that what's available
	* DESC15 didn't have any code, 
	* one of the others has a link to the repo IN THEIR PAPER but it's empty for >3 years
	* the last one has >40 unnamed command-line-args!
	==> This is not how to science, I want to do it better.

==> Before applying it, we should sanity-check their algorithm
==> This thesis should ALSO result in a pipeline die es future research leichter macht ebengenau das zu tun was ich hier tu und die validiät der claims zu prüfen etc.
