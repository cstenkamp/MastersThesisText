# PUT SOMEWHERE 

# ROUGHLY CONCLUSION

* The fundamental information retrieval problem - no 1:1 correspondance to words and meanings (polysemy, synonymy)! two people choose the same main key word for a single well-known object less than 20% of the time [[1] of \cite{deerwester90}]
    * Can use LSA to, once the corresponding clusters are found, select a good one of that as representative: add pseudodocs with only one term and that term as name, and then let all DOCUMENTNAMES be candidates
