# FROM COURSE

We want structured knowledge bases
    * extend using commonsense reasoning, the way humans deal with incomplete knowledge

Commonsense Reasoning:
    * Similarity based rasoning. Basically the same as collaborative filtering, [S1], k-NN
        * Problems: Requires sufficiently similar concepts, context dependency
    * Interpolative Reasoning   


    
* In ANNs you have quantitative reasoning, based on similarity: a' -> b' holds iff a -> b and a $\approx$ a'
* In CS we have qualitative reasoning:
    * bet(p,q,r) that q lies on the line between p and r
    * par(p,q,r,s) also exists
    * from that many things regarding interpolation and extrapolation follow, geez (bet1, bet2, par1, par2) (slide 64 of 09 of CS course)
* Generalized Modus Ponens: "The more the input A is close to A_i, the more the output B must be close to B_i"


## Reasoning in CS

* Similarity
	* \q{What is, then, an appropriate theoretical model [for similarity]? Similarity data from direct or indirect measurements are usually interpreted as proximity data, giving information about the distance btween objects in a conpecutal space [...]. Multidimensional scaling is a typical technique for reconstructing spaces from similarity data [...]
