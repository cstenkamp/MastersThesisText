<!-- 
In this thesis, I want to generate a conceptual space for the domain of educational reasources such as university courses, automatically created in data-driven way from their descriptions.

Conceptual Spaces are seen as something that may be able to link sub-symbolic and symbolic approaches by standing in between them: In Conceptual Spaces, Concepts are represented as convex regions in high-dimensional spaces. Optimally, these spaces are cartesian, and the axes correspond to human-interpretable dimensions. If that is the case, you could for example classify the concept of "Apple" as a region that is in the color-dimension somwhere between green and red, and in the form-dimension roughly at "round".
Creating these concpetual spaces is a very cumbersome task, which is why an automated method may lead to reasonable results. Unfortunately, this is still computationally very complex.
The method of [DESC15] uses MDS, blablabla, then a Support-Vector-Machine separating concepts, and the orthogonal of the separating hyperplane is then an axis

* SIDDATA wants to provide several ways of course recommendation
* Being able to recommand "Like this course, but with less math" would be great
* That is fulfilled by Conceptual Spaces. 
* automatic data-driven generation of CS would be nice
* Method of \cite{Derrarc2015} is good, so we'll apply that to our domain
* And while doing that, implement a scalable open-source architecture for stuff like this bc it doesn't exist yet.
