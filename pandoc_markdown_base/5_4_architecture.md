## Results regarding the Implementation and Goals for the architecture (in terms of architecture quality)
<!-- Eine meiner 2 research questions ja war "wie sieht eine gute architecture aus", so if the architecture is good and how it (and thus a good architecture) looks are results!! -->

First of all, we wanted to show that 

* this implementation works
* the results of \mainalgos are not a fluke (that the algorithm works at all)

The results on placetypes have shown that that's the case.


We remember, we also wanted to build a good architecture and set goals for that, such as adaptability to new datasets etc. We said a good architecture would show in adaptability, scability, ..., so we wanna show that these are achieved. 

* We are scalable and can run massively parallel (that you'll have to believe me, it's one command to run on the grid and I would say that's pretty noice).
* Keep in mind when reading the other sections of the results that all plots and tables you'll see are explictly linked and easily re-creatable and runnable
* We ran the stuff on other datasets\footnote{See Table with datasets and the respective notebooks and the quick datasets section} and it ran through, so we're adaptable.
    *  wie schnell es geht den bums auf neue datasets zu werfen (100k coursera, 90k short stories, ...) und dass ich damit schon angefangen hab 

* dass sowohl die architektur hierfür, als auch meine Grid-solutions eine major contribution sind die sich sehen lassen können!
* Development was really easy as soon as the architecture did what it should so yes, future work will be made a lot easier, our goal of "Make a good architecture" (see \autoref{sec:goals_research_questions} is fulfilled.)
