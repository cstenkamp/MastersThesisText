* Obvious candidates:
    * Well, first of all of course I'm basing my stuff on [DESC15]
    * I hope that I can also bring in some stuff of the follow-up papers of this, eg [1, 2, 3]
    * Just as much as [DESC15] is similar to it, my work is similar to [THE MOVIETAGGER THINGY]


* Das was ich mache ist ja eig auch sehr nah an Topic Modeling:
    * https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/discovering-hidden-topics-python: 
    * "Topic Modeling automatically discover the hidden themes from given documents. It is an unsupervised text analytics algorithm that is used for finding the group of words from the given document. These group of words represents a topic. There is a possibility that, a single document can associate with multiple themes. for example, a group words such as 'patient', 'doctor', 'disease', 'cancer', ad 'health' will represents topic 'healthcare'"
    * Topic modeling is the process of discovering groups of co-occurring words in text documents. These group co-occurring related words makes "topics". It is a form of unsupervised learning, so the set of possible topics are unknown.
    * In contrast to classification it's unsupervised and not single-class

## Tag-Genome

Tag Genome, is based on keywords that users have explicitly as- signed to movies, together with a supervised learning process aimed at re- ducing the sparsity of these assignments and to learn a degree of relevance for terms (rather than just having binary assignments).

=> Schreiben dass in nem Klassifikationstask von DESC15 "welches keyword beschreibt den unterschied zwischen film1 und film2 am besten?" tag genome DEUTLICH besser war, aber well das ist halt supervised.
