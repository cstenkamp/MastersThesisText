DATASETS:OTHER SECTION PRE-TEXT



Also tried a dataset of 100.000 coursera course reviews from \url{https://www.kaggle.com/septa97/100k-courseras-course-reviews-dataset}. Why? Because it's also eduactional resources, but as it's reviews it seems closer to the movies dataset
See \url{https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/coursera-course-reviews} for exploratory analysis of the dataset (there he also has another dataset he writes about, but you cannot merge them unfortunately, so besides course name the only possible task is the rating)
%TODO: I could try to merge it with this one https://www.kaggle.com/siddharthm1698/coursera-course-dataset or another one (see https://www.kaggle.com/mihirs16/coursera-course-data which links names to links, https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=coursera+in%3Adatasets for other places)

Also, there's the Large Movie Review Dataset\footnote{\url{http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/}, \url{https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html}}, also used by \cite{Ager2018}.
