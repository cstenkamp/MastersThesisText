DATASETS:OTHER SECTION PRE-TEXT

One of the goals was to build an adaptable architecture, so we also want to check if we can quickly and easily create other datasets. 

To stay close to our domain of educational resources, we thus created one of short stories (similar in the sense that they are just texts and not concatenations of reviews or smth like all of the datasets of \cite{Derrac2015}), and one of coursera course reviews (is in the educational domain but is reviews). 

No analysis of these will be in this thesis bc it's outside the scope, it was only about if it can run through, and believe me it can.


Also tried a dataset of 100.000 coursera course reviews from \url{https://www.kaggle.com/septa97/100k-courseras-course-reviews-dataset}. Why? Because it's also eduactional resources, but as it's reviews it seems closer to the movies dataset
See \url{https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/coursera-course-reviews} for exploratory analysis of the dataset (there he also has another dataset he writes about, but you cannot merge them unfortunately, so besides course name the only possible task is the rating)
%TODO: I could try to merge it with this one https://www.kaggle.com/siddharthm1698/coursera-course-dataset or another one (see https://www.kaggle.com/mihirs16/coursera-course-data which links names to links, https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=coursera+in%3Adatasets for other places)

Also, there's the Large Movie Review Dataset\footnote{\url{http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/}, \url{https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html}}, also used by \cite{Ager2018}.
