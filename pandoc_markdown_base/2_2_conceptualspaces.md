% Genereller Kram Ã¼ber vector space models (siehe Kurs, Slides 2, von Nico)

% \cite{Alshaikh2019} (verbatim!):
% * vector space models that are aimed at representing the entities of a given kind (e.g. movies), to- gether with their associated properties (e.g. scary) and concepts (e.g. thrillers).
% * As such, they are similar in spirit to the vector space models that have been proposed in information retrieval (Deer- wester et al., 1990) and natural language pro- cessing (Turney and Pantel, 2010; Mikolov et al., 2013), but there are also notable differences.
% * First, in the context of conceptual spaces, an explicit dis- tinction is made between the entities from the do- main of discourse, which are represented as vec- tors, and the corresponding properties and con- cepts, which are represented as regions (e.g. poly- topes) or soft regions (e.g. characterized by a Gaussian). 
% * Second, conceptual spaces are organ- ised into a set of facets [domains], each of which captures a different aspect of meaning. For instance, in a conceptual space of movies, we may have facets such as genre, language, geographic location, etc. Each facet is associated with its own vector space, which intuitively captures similarity w.r.t. the corresponding facet. Most of these facet spaces tend to be low-dimensional (e.g. modelling budget only needs a single dimension). This clearly dif- ferentiates them from traditional semantic spaces, which often have hundreds of dimensions
