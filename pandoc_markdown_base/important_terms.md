#### Distributional Hypothesis

Firth (1968) observed that “you shall know a word by the company it keeps”. (I have it from \cite{Lowe}, see the cite there).

words that occur in similar surroundings (pieces of text) have similar meanings.  "Hunde sind süß" und "katzen sind süß" -> in some context, the words "hunde" and "katzen" are similar.
