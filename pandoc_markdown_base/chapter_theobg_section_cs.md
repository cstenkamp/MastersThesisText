* Knowledge representation method:
	* Representational format with rich semantics
* Originally created by Peter Gärdenfors \cite{Gardenfors2000a}
	* Created as better tool for semantic web (keep in mind, it's 2000, where that was all the rage)
	* Use case: Should be a representational level below the symbolic level (...making it superflous, as the concept hierachies are generated automatically - the validity of "a robin is a bird" is encoded because it is a subregion)
	* Claims to have richer semantic structure than RDS/OWL/the entire idea of ontologies
		* Why? Because information processing is not, as historically thought, pure deductive reasoning (→ syllogisms) - no strict is-a relations but also concepts like similiarity, which the original semantic web languages couldn't represent
		* Other problems with ontologies and reasoning systems are that they assume explicit, unambiguous, universally agreed-upon truths which are explicitly described, which he argues is not how the world is.
