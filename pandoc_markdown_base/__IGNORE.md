* The fact that I don't use intercepts of the decision_planes in derive_conceptualspace.semantic_directions.create_candidate_svm.select_salient_terms (dass ich beim ganzen koordinatensystem-schieben den intercept ignoriere!)
* Anhand von set-overlapts von meinen placetypes zu deren "die hyperparam kombi die am closesten zu deren ergebnissen ist" sagen können
* dass sie, wenn sie die orthogonalen der decision-planes averagen, definitiv auch den intercept berücksichtigen müssten!
        (...would they? I mean they are only concerned with direction and ranking, so there it's just an added, irrelevant, constant)
* Check my claim in the results for place-types (chapter 6.1), that the classification based on word embeddings may even be better than their SVM_MDS


* In his chapter "Computational Aspects" gärdenfors says:
even ANNs, concretely Kohonen's Self-organizing maps \cite{Kohonen1997}, which automatically reduce the representational complexity of the input while preserving similarities (of beliebiger distance function) among the different input vectors by mapping input vectors with common featurs to \textit{neighboring} neurons in the output map, thus preserving topological relations while making it lower-dimensional.

* TABELLE which parameter-combis were USED, with optimal ones MARKED for \mainalgos (-> also into yaml!)
