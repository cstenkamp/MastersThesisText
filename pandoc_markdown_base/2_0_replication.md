#### Reproducibility and Sustainability

Or: How I plan to ensure the code I'm writing is good





#### How to replicate

<!-- Ja, das hier sollte drin sein, ich geh in methods:datasets drauf ein -->


What we want to do just that: apply an existing algorithm to another domain.Replicating other's work on new datasets is important! See 


So one main motivation is to reproduce the code for the paper I liked in a way that adheres to the aforementioned principles, such that others that find it interesting don't have to go through the shit I had to go through.

Principles of open science are very important to me, so I want to ensure that the claims I am making in this thesis are backed by code that is scalable, reproducible, modular, easily-understood, easily set up and run, well documented, ... . To support this, I will as often as necessary refer to the actual code in this thesis, to allow to understand and reproduce the claims and results, and also highly encourage to critically read everything here and check the respective code (...and let me know if you spot any errors! Just open a Github Issue!)

  


Important subgoal to achieve these: Modularization and allowing components of the pipeline to easily be exchanged and extended
