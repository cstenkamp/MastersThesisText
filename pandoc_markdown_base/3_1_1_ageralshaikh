Regarding Ager and Alshaikh:

* Who said that binary occurence was the best metric? I can't believe that
* Who said kappa is a bad value?
* \textcite{Ager2018} 
    * 
* \textcite{Alshaikh2020}
    * Well, do the stuff iterative cluster stuff
        * "When representing a particular entity in a conceptual space, we need to specify which domains it belongs to, and for each of these domains we need to provide a corresponding vector." 
        * then they show their example of something that is not seperable with a hyperplane unless we specify subdomains, maybe just steal their plot that explains their one contribution to 99%
    * Cluster with affinity propagation
    * Do Kappa on Binary (-> see later)
        * for them, the binary "does the word occur in the description" is the only sensible signal, no ppmi or anything! (page 2, footnote 1 of RaZb20)
