\chapter{Results}

This section summarizes the results that the described algorithm achieved on the described datasets according to the described metrics. Before going into detail about the performance on the Siddata-dataset, a brief summary of the results on the placetypes-dataset serves to demonstrate if the specific implementation can achieve comparable results to \mainalgos, thus putting the other results into perspective in terms of what the algorithm can realistically achieve on dedicated high-quality datasets.

% Due to the implemented algorithm being an \gls{unsupervised} algorithm, there is no explicit target value for each of the considered samples, making it impossible to straight-forwardly apply well-known \gls{ml} metrics such as \Gls{acc} or \gls{f1}. What this algorithm tries to achieve is a lot \textit{fuzzier} than in the realm of classification: The end-goal of it is to embed the given \glspl{entity} into a vector-space that consists of semantically meaniningful directions, so the only actual metric would be a comparison checking if the respective categorization here corresponds closely to human judgement. To do that, the best evaluation is likely a study that asks for feedback of users that see the results of a developed system\footnote{An example for such a system is the \textit{Movie Tuner} interface from \textcite{VISR12}, reprinted as \autoref{fig:movetuner}.}. \textcite{Derrac2015} performed crowdsourcing experiments on CrowdFlower\footnote{\url{http://www.crowdflower.com}}, asking users among other tasks which of several candidates could best describe the difference between two movies. They also compared their results with those of running the supervised algorithm of \cite{VISR12} on a subset of their data. Furthermore they tested if the explainable classifiers generated from this algorithm (see \autoref{sec:reasoning}) \q{help users spot incorrect classifications} \cite[48]{Derrac2015}, as well as if their algorithmic classification corresponds to human judgement\footnote{The task was set only for classification into OpenCYC and Foursquare Taxonomies of the placetypes-dataset (see column `\textbf{classification classes}' in \autoref{tab:all_datasets}).}. 
% \todoparagraph{TODO: Should I also quickly mention their results?}
% While similar studies could be done in the Siddata-\gls{dsa} \cite{Schurz2021} without additional costs, carrying these out is outside the scope of this thesis.


% This thesis relies on both qualitative analysis and quantitative anlaysis in order to quantify the algorithm's performance. In the \textit{qualitative analysis}, exemplary partial results of the algorithm will be showcased that should intuitively show if what the algorithm does looks \textit{realistic} from a human perspective. 

\section{Replicating the results for placetypes}
\label{sec:results_placetypes}

To check if the implementation correctly produces the claimed results, it was applied to \gencite{Derrac2015} placetypes-dataset and its results compared to those of the literature. \autoref{fig:scatter_mds_placetypes} in \autoref{ap:more_plots} shows a two-dimensional \gls{tsne}-embedding of the original representations of \cite{Derrac2015}, colored by their Geonames-class. This figure indicates that only few of the entities are linked with a class and that the embeddings barely cluster when compared to their embeddings for the movies-dataset (displayed in \autoref{fig:scatter_mds_movies}). 

Both \cite{Ager2018} and \cite{Alshaikh2020} report the performance of depth-1, depth-3 and unbounded decision trees classifying an entities' category according to the Placetypes- and Geonames-taxonomy. \autoref{tab:f1_mainalgos_me_short} lists their results as well as some of their baselines in comparison with the results of this work. As shown in the table, this implementation outperforms the previous results for all configurations. \autoref{tab:f1_geonames_foursquare_all} shows the results of different configurations to generate the decision-tree classification. In contrast to the results reported in \ref{tab:f1_mainalgos_me_short} which are optimized for their respective classification target, these results are from a single parameter-combination and robustly reproducible.

\section{Dataset differences} % Dataset comparisons (is our dataset worse?)
\label{sec:results_datasetdiffs}


Having established that the implementation works correctly for the domain of placetypes, we will now check if the quantity of some key characteristics produced as interim results of the algorithm differ across domains. \autoref{tab:generated_stuff} contrasts the number of feature vectors, candidate terms and cluster elements for the movies-, placetypes- and Siddata-dataset.

The Siddata-dataset consists of more but shorter texts associated with an entity (visualized in \autoref{tab:corpussizes}), which is why there are much less words in the respective texts that exceed a given \gls{df} for the Siddata when compared to the originally used ones (visualized in \autoref{tab:summed_unique_words}). The algorithm uses a \gls{svm} to split entities that contain a phrase from those that do not, which performs bad for heavily imbalanced class sizes. \autoref{fig:candidate_histogram} shows the distribution of texts per candidate as histogram. It shows that 90\% of the 10\,060 candidates occur in 26 to 375 of the 11\,601 documents. The median number of documents is 49, meaning that for half of the keyphrases only 0.42\% of the samples are in the positive class.

\section{Results for the Siddata-dataset}
\label{sec:results_siddata}

\todoparagraph{The plots here show the results from several different parameter-configurations. Because of that, the extracted semantic directions and also the metrics may differ between the plots. This is not a bug but a feature - they are all differnent but all are nice}

As previously described, the primary method used here to check if the described methodology works for the domain of educational resources is to check if low-depth decision trees trained on the extracted semantic directions of the Siddata-dataset can classify a courses' faculty. Before doing that however, it is important to first validate if it can reasonably assumed that the faculty \textit{can generally} be extracted from only the descriptions associated with the entities.

\subsection*{Extracing Faculty without the algorithm}

	  % möchte sagen: Die Embeddings Clustern -> es lassen sich "sinnvolle Sachen" (wie faculty) draus ziehen.
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

To see if it is possible to extract any kind of structured data from the unstructured course descriptions, a \gls{bert}-based Neural Network classifier was trained on the dataset, classifying the subset of courses that are for the \gls{uos} to the faculty they belong to. The classifier trained for 12 epochs before \emph{stopping early} due to its performance on the test-set decreasing. It achieved an accuracy of \textbf{85.19\%} for the test-set (94.13\% on the training set), providing strong indication that the faculty can be considered a latent property of its description. Because \gls{bert} is one of the best general language classifiers to date \cite{Devlin2019}, this accuracy will be considered the upper boundary for the results of our algorithm.

\autoref{fig:scatter_mds_siddata} displays a \gls{tsne}-representation of the dissimilarity-matrix generated from the normalized angular distances (\autoref{eq:norm_ang_dist}) of the \gls{bow}-representations generated from the courses (only those that have one, which are \todoparagraph{somany}) Compared to the placetypes-dataset (\autoref{fig:scatter_mds_placetypes}), at least some of the classes seem to cluster well. 

From this distance matrix, the algorithm subsequently creates an embedding using the \gls{mds}-algorithm to afterwards train multiple \glspl{svm} for each of the extracted candidate-dimensions before re-embedding the entities into a new space where the dimensions encode the \gls{rank} for each of the extracted features. To evaluate the algorithm, we will check if it is to be able to classify the faculty with a decision tree that uses between one and maximally $2^3=8$ of these features. To provide a context for the resulting performance, we will first look at a classification which does not use the feature-based representation, but on a raw low-dimensional embedding without class-specific dimensions. This can be seen as the lower boundary of what a classification without selecting the most relevant dimensions but instead use an optimal but general three-dimensional space can achieve. A classification-performance of low-level decision trees that use only the most important features from all available ones that is higher than this thus provides evidence that the detected features encode important distinctive properties. \autoref{fig:mds_3d_hyperplane} visually represents the result of the classification using a linear \gls{svm} on a three-dimensional space generated as result of \gls{mds} on the dissimilarity-matrix of the entities. Averaged over all Faculties, this classifier reaches a weighted accuracy of 64.3\% (unweighted accuracy 69.0\%, weighted F1: 0.414, unweighted F1: 0.269). Note that these values are reached by training on the full data without a separate testing-set.

Now that we have established upper and lower boundary for what can reasonably be expected from the algorithm, let us finally look at the performance of its decision-trees, to gain evidence if human concepts are encoded in its extracted features. \autoref{tab:robustresults_perfb} lists average accuracies per faculty for decision trees created on the basis of a single hyperparameter-configuration that was selected to achive high performance on average. The respective values are the average and standard-deviation of runs with 5-fold crossvalidation each for trees of various depths.

Keep in mind that accuracies often makes the situation look better than it is. The weighted average F1-scores are between 0.505 (depth 1) and 0.710 (unbounded depth). For the full table of F1-scores it is referred to the appendix, specifically \autoref{tab:robustresults_perfb_f1}. 

Compared with the results of the \gls{bert}-based classifier (85.19\%), the achieved results are suprisingly competative, with the weighted mean of trees of depth 1 and two only slighly below that and that of deeper trees achieving even higher accuracies. Importantly however, the results reported here are those of a sepearate classifier per faculty (1-vs-rest), differentiating only between the respective faculty as positive class and all other faculties as negative class. As will be further elaborated in the discussion, this is however the only realistic way of doing it: A binary tree of depth 1 can distinct between maximally two classes and thus maximally achieve a classification by perfectly classifying the most frequent class and labelling all samples as the second most frequent class, which in the case of faculties is $(2011+1665)/7081=51.9\%$. Results for such trees are reported in \autoref{tab:robustresults_allatonce}.

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis}

The main goal of the algorithm is not to optimally classify the respective faculties optimally, but to find semantic directions. Thus, once it has been established that the performance is reasonably well, looking at the names of these directions is just as important. \autoref{fig:dims_for_fb} visually represents decision-trees for each of the faculties of depth one, \ie trees that can only use a single semantic direction for their decision. With the exception of the faculties \emph{Physik} and \emph{Biologie/Chemie}, the semantic directions that best predict each faculty appear very relevant to the respective topic.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

For trees deeper than one level, the selected features from the second level on are not necessarily the most important ones. Instead it is possible to extract the most important features for a classification by looking at the respective information gain achieved by splitting it. \autoref{tab:courses_top3} displays three most important directions for each of the respective faculties. While the details of this result will be eloborated upon in the discussion, most of the detected features appear convincing. Regarding an acutal classification using these features, \autoref{fig:boxes_rechtswis} in the Appendix displays the result of a sample classification of a decision tree with three features.

\autoref{fig:3dplot_mathe_infoab} displays a 3D-Embedding for courses, splitting courses which contain the term "\textit{mathematik}" from those that don't, also hightlighting the courses \textit{Informatik A} and \textit{Informatik B}. Both courses appear comparably close (\todoparagraph{their distance, mean distance}) to each other. Further, even though neither course description contains the word \textit{mathematik}, both courses are would receive high values for this feature, indicated by the distance to the decision plane\footnote{Both statements are better visible in the interactive version of the plot, which can be found at \todoparagraph{link!!}}.

\section{Optimal Parameters}
\label{sec:results_params}

The previous sections displayed results for a parameter-combination that performed well on average for the aforementioned classification-task. This section compares all of the parameter-combinations that were considered. 

As described in \autoref{sec:workflow}, a good first approximation is to check how many candidate-terms get a kappa-score which is above the threshold of 0.5. \autoref{tab:kappa_table} shows the results of many runs with different parameter-combinations with the purpose of figuring out which combination of parameters and kappa-metrics lead to enough candidate-terms (\todoparagraph{Also ref the figure of workflow where I check what threshold was realistic})

\input{include/results_table_1}

\todoparagraph{What kappas mean what}

After preliminary analysis with the number of kappas, let us also look at the performance of the parameter-combinations for the decision-trees. \autoref{tab:best_params} lists the accuracies of of the decision-trees classifying a course's faculty per parameter-combination. Specifically, this compares accuracies for several one-vs-rest decision trees of depth one with a test-set size of 33\%.
