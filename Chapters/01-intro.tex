In this thesis, I want to generate a conceptual space for the domain of university courses, automatically created in data-driven way from their descriptions.

\section{Reading Instructions}

\paragraph*{Document Structure}
\todoparagraph{
	Chapter 1 is Intro, with motivations etc. 
	Chapter 2 is Background, explaining the the required concepts - what are conceptual spaces generally, how does the base algorithm work, what kinds of algorithms occur in it. I am explaining the rquired algorithm before the main algo such that I can rely on definitions there.
	Chapter 3 is then methods. Dataset, algorithm, architecture. 
	4 results, 5 conclusion, that's it.
