Users may apply them without awareness of their surprising omissions (e.g. {\{}``{\}}hasn{\{}'{\}}t{\{}''{\}} but not {\{}``{\}}hadn{\{}'{\}}t{\{}''{\}}) and inclusions ({\{}``{\}}computer{\{}''{\}}), or their incompatibility with a particular tokenizer. Motivated by issues raised about the Scikit-learn stop list, we investigate variation among and consistency within 52 popular English-language stop lists, and propose strategies for mitigating these issues.},

abstract = {This paper surveys the work of the qualitative spatial reasoning group at the University of Leeds. The group has developed a number of logical calculi for representing and reasoning with qualitative spatial relations over regions. We motivate the use of regions as the primary spatial entity and show how a rich language can be built up from surprisingly few primitives. This language can distinguish between convex and a variety of concave shapes and there is also an extension which handles regions with uncertain boundaries. We also present a variety of reasoning techniques, both for static and dynamic situations. A number of possible application areas are briefly mentioned.},

@techreport{Alshaikh2020,
abstract = {Conceptual spaces are geometric meaning representations in which similar entities are represented by similar vectors. They are widely used in cog-nitive science, but there has been relatively little work on learning such representations from data. In particular, while standard representation learning methods can be used to induce vector space embed-dings from text corpora, these differ from conceptual spaces in two crucial ways. First, the dimensions of a conceptual space correspond to salient semantic features, known as quality dimensions, whereas the dimensions of learned embeddings typically lack any clear interpretation. This has been partially addressed in previous work, which has shown that it is possible to identify directions in learned vector spaces which capture semantic features. Second, conceptual spaces are normally or-ganised into a set of domains, each of which is associated with a separate vector space. In contrast, learned embeddings represent all entities in a single vector space. Our hypothesis in this paper is that such single-space representations are sub-optimal for learning quality dimensions, due to the fact that semantic features are often only relevant to a subset of the entities. We show that this issue can be mitigated by identifying features in a hierarchical fashion. Intuitively, the top-level features split the vector space into domains, allowing us to subsequently identify domain-specific quality dimensions.},

abstract = {Understanding the process of categorization is a primary research goal in artificial intelligence. The conceptual space framework provides a flexible approach to modeling context-sensitive categorization via a geometrical representation designed for modeling and managing concepts. In this paper we show how algorithms developed in computational geometry, and the Region Connection Calculus can be used to model important aspects of categorization in conceptual spaces. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility of using existing geometric algorithms to build and manage categories in conceptual spaces, and we show how the Region Connection Calculus can be used to reason about categories and other conceptual regions.},

abstract = {This article introduces the tag genome, a data structure that extends the traditional tagging model to provide enhanced forms of user interaction. Just as a biological genome encodes an organism based on a sequence of genes, the tag genome encodes an item in an information space based on its relationship to a common set of tags. We present a machine learning approach for computing the tag genome, and we evaluate several learning models on a ground truth dataset provided by users. We describe an application of the tag genome called Movie Tuner which enables users to navigate from one item to nearby items along dimensions represented by tags. We present the results of a 7-week field trial of 2,531 users of Movie Tuner and a survey evaluating users subjective experience. Finally, we outline the broader space of applications of the tag genome. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

@techreport{Derrac2015,
abstract = {Commonsense reasoning patterns such as interpolation and a fortiori inference have proven useful for dealing with gaps in structured knowledge bases. An important diculty in applying these reasoning patterns in practice is that they rely on fine-grained knowledge of how di↵erent concepts and entities are semantically related. In this paper, we show how the required semantic relations can be learned from a large collection of text documents. To this end, we first induce a conceptual space from the text documents, using multi-dimensional scaling. We then rely on the key insight that the required semantic relations correspond to qualitative spatial relations in this conceptual space. Among others, in an entirely unsupervised way, we identify salient directions in the conceptual space which correspond to interpretable relative properties such as 'more fruity than' (in a space of wines), resulting in a symbolic and interpretable representation of the conceptual space. To evaluate the quality of our semantic relations, we show how they can be exploited by a number of commonsense reasoning based classifiers. We experimentally show that these classifiers can outperform standard approaches, while being able to provide intuitive explanations of classification decisions. A number of crowdsourcing experiments provide further insights into the nature of the extracted semantic relations.},

@inproceedings{Ager2018,
abstract = {In this paper we consider semantic spaces consisting of objects from some particular domain (e.g. IMDB movie reviews). Various authors have observed that such semantic spaces often model salient features (e.g. how scary a movie is) as directions. These feature directions allow us to rank objects according to how much they have the corresponding feature, and can thus play an important role in interpretable classifiers, recommendation systems, or entity-oriented search engines, among others. Methods for learning semantic spaces, however, are mostly aimed at modelling similarity. In this paper, we argue that there is an inherent trade-off between capturing similarity and faithfully modelling features as directions. Following this observation, we propose a simple method to fine-tune existing semantic spaces, with the aim of improving the quality of their feature directions. Crucially, our method is fully unsupervised, requiring only a bag-of-words representation of the objects as input.},

@article{Gardenfors2004,
abstract = {The Semantic Web is not semantic. It is good for syllogistic reasoning, but there is much more to semantics than syllogisms. I argue that the current Semantic Web is too dependent on symbolic representations of information structures, which limits its representational capacity. As a remedy, I propose conceptual spaces as a tool for expressing more of the semantics. Conceptual spaces are built up from quality dimensions that have geometric or topological structures. With the aid of the dimensions, similarities between objects can easily be represented and it is argued that similarity is a central aspect of semantic content. By sorting the dimensions into domains, I define properties and concepts and show how prototype effects of concepts can be treated with the aid of conceptual spaces. I present an outline of how one can reconstruct most of the taxonomies and other meta-data that are explicitly coded in the current Semantic Web and argue that inference engines on the symbolic level will become largely superfluous. As an example of the semantic power of conceptual spaces, I show how concept combinations can be analysed in a much richer and more accurate way than in the classical logical approach.},
