# Chris' Master's Thesis

Download compiled PDF [here](https://nightly.link/cstenkamp/MastersThesisText/workflows/create_pdf_artifact/master/Thesis.zip) if available [or just from my website](https://cstenkamp.de/assets/masterthesis.pdf).
The freshly compiled version contains a version without the pandoc-compiled markdown files (which I don't count as final pages), and a two-sided version without colored links for printing. Print-version is [also on my website](https://cstenkamp.de/assets/masterthesis_forprinting.pdf)
